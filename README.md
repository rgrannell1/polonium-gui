# Polonium (GUI) V0.4.1

<img src="example.png"> </img>

A node-webkit gui for [Polonium](https://github.com/rgrannell1/polonium), a stateless password manager.

### Requirements

* Ubuntu (tested on 14.10)
* xclip
* Node.js v0.11.13
* Node Webkit 0.8.6
* Bignum
* Is

### Installation

Polonium-GUI is not particularily easy to install on Ubuntu as certain packages required by node-webkit are unavailable.

To install Polonium-GUI, simply git clone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rgrannell1/polonium-gui.git
cd polonium-gui
```

# -- Node Webkit

Now run execute.sh within that folder

```bash
sh execute.sh
```

This should download node-webkit to a folder in `~/polonium-gui'. Unfortunately
Node Webkit requires libudev.so.0, a library not available within Ubuntu. This
requires you to edit the nw executable manually. (instructions taken from 'daniel'
on [askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/288821/how-do-i-resolve-a-cannot-open-shared-object-file-libudev-so-0-error)).

```bash
cd ~/polonium-gui/node-webkit-v0.8.6-linux-x64
sudo apt-get install hexedit
sudo hexedit nw
```
Search for the string `libudev.so.0`:

* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
* Press <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd>.
* Type `libudev.so.0`.

Now change the 0 in `libudev.so.0` to 1 so the string is `libudev.so.1`, which is available to Ubuntu.

* Use the arrow keys to select the 0 in `libudev.so.0`.
* Press 1.

Now exit and save

* Press <kbd>Ctrl + x</kbd>.
* Press <kbd>y</kbd> to save.

The node-webkit executable should now work as expected.

### - Node

To install node.js on Ubuntu use

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
